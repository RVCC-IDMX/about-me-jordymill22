# Description
The purpose of my About Me project was to learn the skills needed to develop a quality website. Some of the first major skills I learned was the proper use of commands within HTML and CSS; crafting static web pages, while coming to an understanding of the role of tags, elements, and styling rules. I also learned how to implement responsive web design, ensuring any changes I made would be able to adapt to various devices. Another skill I honed in development of my website was crafting interactive componets. I learned how to create forms, sliders, as well as the nav bar. Lastly, I was introduced to the process of actual deployment of my creations through websites like Github and Netlify. The final stage also taught me to make and correctly format my own logo. During the stage of adding a blog article, I learned to bold and italicize through HTML. 

# Color Scheme
The color scheme of my project was based on my favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox. I also wanted to create a more vintage effect, using a off-whitish font color rather than white; also found this to be easier on the eyes. 
## RGB/Hex Codes
