# Description:
The purpose of my About Me project was to learn the skills needed to develop a quality website. Some of the first major skills I learned was the proper use of commands within HTML and CSS; crafting static web pages, while coming to an understanding of the role of tags, elements, and styling rules. I also learned how to implement responsive web design, ensuring any changes I made would be able to adapt to various devices. Another skill I honed in development of my website was crafting interactive componets. I learned how to create forms, sliders, as well as the nav bar. Lastly, I was introduced to the process of actual deployment of my creations through websites like Github and Netlify. 

# Color Scheme:
The color scheme of my project was based on my favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox. I also wanted to create a more vintage effect, using a off-whitish font color rather than white; also found this to be easier on the eyes.
